# LEMBIT SOCKET SERVER(Load Balancing)
A simple application to test REST and SocketIO connectivity and load balancer experiment with node.js deployement models with help of nginx.


# Building locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Running application
This Application accepts argments, each of which is optional. Below are the arguments with their default values:

`node server.js --name default --port 3001`

`name` - the name that this node will report in API (useful for load-balancing checks)

`port` - port to listen to (host is hardcoded to 127.0.0.1)

To run with PM2 (example with two instances on different ports to match with `conf/nginx/load-balancing.conf` configuration)

```
pm2 start --name socket-1 server.js -- --name socket-1 --port 3001
pm2 start --name socket-2 server.js -- --name socket-2 --port 3002
pm2 start --name socket-3 server.js -- --name socket-3 --port 3003
```

# Project Structure
The node.js app contains only one file - `server.js`. There are some static files to present a (reasonably awkward) 
UI in `public` folder.

# Environment Variable
Need to Add some configuration on `.env` file. This file removed for secqurity reason

```
cp env.txt .env
```
And add you cinfiguration on .env file

NGINX configs are in `nginx/socket1-stagingtr.lembits.in.conf` folder

# API
An application exposes REST and SocketIO APIs

## REST API

`GET /api/test ` - dumps request headers as well as remote IP as seen by node.js app (good to test if proxy passes the IP)

`GET /api/name ` - responds with the node name (see command line parameters above)

`GET /api/info ` - responds with app version, reading it from `version.txt` file or 0 if no file is present, value of `__dirname` and `process.cwd()`. Useful to see which version is being served and where is it served from

## SocketIO API
For every connected client, an application listens to `heartbeat` event. Once event is received, server will send back `heartbeat` event with the same payload as client sent, adding the name of the node that processed event. Useful to test socket.io connectivity as well as roundtrip times.
